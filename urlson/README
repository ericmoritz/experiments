urlson is a very basic dictionary to URL encoder/decoder.

passing the following dictionary to dumps()::

   {'name': 'Test', 'list': [1,2,3]}

Will be produce the following urlencoded string::

   name=Test&list=1&list=2&list=3

Conversely, passing the above urlencoding string to loads() will produce::

   {'name': 'Test', 'list': [1,2,3]}

There is nothing more to it.  It does not support nested dictionaries or
nested lists, so K.I.S.S.
