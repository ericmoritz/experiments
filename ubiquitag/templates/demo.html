<p>A bicycle, also known as a bike, pushbike or cycle, is a
pedal-driven, human-powered, single-track vehicle, having two wheels
attached to a frame, one behind the other. A person who rides a
bicycle is called a cyclist or a bicyclist.</p>

<p>Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century and now number about
one billion worldwide, twice as many as automobiles.[1] They are the
principal means of transportation in many regions. They also provide a
popular form of recreation, and have been adapted for such uses as
children's toys, adult fitness, military and police applications,
courier services and bicycle racing.</p>

<p>The basic shape and configuration of a typical upright bicycle has
changed little since the first chain-driven model was developed around
1885.[2] However, many details have been improved, especially since
the advent of modern materials and computer-aided design. These have
allowed for a proliferation of specialized designs for particular
types of cycling.</p>

<p>The invention of the bicycle has had an enormous impact on society,
both in terms of culture and of advancing modern industrial
methods. Several components that eventually played a key role in the
development of the automobile were originally invented for the
bicycle </p>
